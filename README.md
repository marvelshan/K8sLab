## TechForum (formerly K8sLab)

This repository started as **K8sLab**, a personal sandbox for exploring Kubernetes — diving deep into container orchestration, cluster management, and scalable deployments.

Over time, it has evolved into a broader **technical forum** — a place where I document, analyze, and reflect on engineering topics across cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, DevOps, and software reliability.

Here, I share:

* Technical write-ups and system postmortems
* Architecture experiments and design notes
* Personal reflections on failures, trade-offs, and engineering philosophy

The goal remains the same: **to learn by building, breaking, and understanding systems deeply.**

### Topics Covered

* Kubernetes & Cloud Native Ecosystem
* Distributed Systems & Reliability Engineering
* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm, Nix, etc.)
* Observability, Automation, and Scalability
* Technical Essays & Postmortems

### Vision

> Systems fail, but learning scales.
> This repository captures that learning — one experiment, one failure, and one insight at a time.
